fh-group
========

This is the sample code for my resume submission to fh-group. In it contains the code used in the Lead Management application I wrote for my current employer. The pages contained are

lead_detail.php - this manages the details of each lead, which school and admissions rep it belongs to, reminders about the lead, the lead history, and the leads status. Most of the functionality is handled by ajax requests. I kept the jQuery functions hardcoded in the page for readability, normally it would be stored in a separate file.

dashboard.php - this is the main page of the application where users can view unopened leads they have been assigned, view the leads they are currently working, and reminders for leads.
